# Project Milestones: THC (True Hardcore)

## v1.0 Base Claiming System (Shipped: 2026-01-17)

**Delivered:** Complete territorial progression system where players explore for bell-granted land plots, claim flat chunks as protected bases, and face mining fatigue and placement restrictions in the wild.

**Phases completed:** 1-5 + 4.1, 4.2 (13 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Land plot economy via bell interactions with villager trade removal
- Chunk claiming with terrain flatness validation and village protection
- Base area safety with unrestricted building and combat blocking
- World restrictions with allowlist-only placement and 26-coordinate adjacency rules
- Mining fatigue stacking (1.4^x) with 12-second per-level decay
- Village chunk protection (no destruction except ores and allowlist blocks)
- QoL crafting tweaks (ladder 16x, snowball 64 stack, snow conversion)

**Stats:**

- 58 files created/modified
- ~2,500 lines of Kotlin/Java
- 7 phases (5 integer + 2 inserted bugfixes), 13 plans
- 3 days from start to ship (Jan 15-17, 2026)

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` → `feat(05-01)` (59 commits)

**What's next:** To be determined (v1.1 planning)
