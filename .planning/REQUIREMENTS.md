## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

*No features deferred from v2.1*

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Tipped tiered arrows | Complexity deferred (from PROJECT.md) |
| Totem of Undying functionality on Blast Totem | Blast Totem is item replacement only, not functional duplicate |
