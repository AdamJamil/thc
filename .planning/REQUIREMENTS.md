# Requirements: THC v2.4

**Defined:** 2026-01-25
**Core Value:** Risk must be required for progress. No tedious grinding to avoid challenge.

## v2.4 Requirements

Requirements for Extra Features Batch 8. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Boats & Mounts

- [ ] **BOAT-01**: Iron boat item craftable (5 iron ingots + magma cream in minecart shape)
- [ ] **BOAT-02**: Iron boat uses custom texture (iron_boat.png) and icon (iron_boat_icon.png)
- [ ] **BOAT-03**: Iron boat works on lava the same way regular boats work on water
- [ ] **BOAT-04**: Iron boat item drop is lava-proof and floats (like netherite items)
- [ ] **BOAT-05**: Iron boat item flies towards player when boat is broken
- [ ] **SADL-01**: Saddles removed from all chest loot tables
- [ ] **SADL-02**: Mobs no longer drop saddles
- [ ] **SADL-03**: Saddles cannot be crafted (remove any existing recipe)

### Buckets & Fluids

- [ ] **BUCK-01**: Copper bucket item craftable (standard bucket recipe with copper ingots)
- [ ] **BUCK-02**: Copper bucket can only hold water or milk (not lava, powder snow, etc.)
- [ ] **BUCK-03**: Copper bucket uses custom textures (copper_bucket.png, copper_bucket_of_water.png, copper_bucket_of_milk.png)
- [ ] **BUCK-04**: Lava buckets cannot be placed (right-click does nothing)
- [ ] **WATR-01**: Water placement from buckets creates non-source water at max height
- [ ] **WATR-02**: Placed water has vanilla physics (flows and eventually disappears)

### Flight

- [ ] **ELYT-01**: Fireworks no longer propel player during elytra flight
- [ ] **ELYT-02**: Elytra gains 2x speed when diving
- [ ] **ELYT-03**: Elytra loses 1.8x speed when ascending

### Brewing

- [ ] **BREW-01**: Brewing stands removed from natural spawns (villages, igloos, etc.)
- [ ] **BREW-02**: Brewing stands cannot be crafted
- [ ] **BREW-03**: Potions removed from piglin bartering tables

### Combat/Armor

- [ ] **ARMR-01**: Armor values rebalanced (leather 7, copper 10, iron 15, diamond 18, netherite 10)
- [ ] **ARMR-02**: Toughness values rebalanced (leather 0, copper 0, iron 0, diamond 4, netherite 6)
- [ ] **ARMR-03**: Per-piece distribution ensures each upgrade gives strictly more armor
- [ ] **ARMR-04**: Half armor points allowed on individual pieces (bar rounds down)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future milestones.

(None identified)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Copper armor crafting | Copper buckets are the copper progression item for v2.4 |
| Iron boat with chest | Keep iron boats simple, matches vanilla boat variants |
| Water evaporation in Nether | Non-source water already flows away naturally |
