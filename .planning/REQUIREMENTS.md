# Requirements: THC v1.1 Extra Features Batch 1

**Defined:** 2026-01-18
**Core Value:** Risk must be required for progress. No tedious grinding to avoid challenge - players face meaningful choices where reward demands exposure to danger.

## v1.1 Requirements

- [ ] **DROWN-01**: Once drowning begins, damage ticks occur 4x less frequently (every 4 seconds instead of every 1 second)

### Spear Removal

- [ ] **SPEAR-01**: Player cannot craft any spear (wooden through netherite recipes disabled)
- [ ] **SPEAR-02**: Spears do not appear in structure chest loot (ocean ruins, village weaponsmith, buried treasure, bastion, end city)
- [ ] **SPEAR-03**: Mobs that spawn holding spears do not drop spears on death

- [ ] **PROJ-05**: Player projectiles experience quadratic gravity after traveling 8 blocks (drop faster at range)

## v2 Requirements

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.
