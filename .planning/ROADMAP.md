# Roadmap: THC

## Overview

Combat and survival systems that reinforce risk/reward philosophy. Melee damage weakened, ranged weapons gated behind Trial Chambers, wind charges become core mobility, threat system adds tactical aggro management, world difficulty maximized while bases remain safe, and twilight system creates perpetual hostility.
