# Milestone v1.1: Extra Features Batch 1

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 6-8
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Combat and survival tweaks reinforcing risk/reward - drowning is more forgiving, spears removed from player acquisition, projectiles create danger through hit effects and enhanced physics.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Drowning Modification

**Goal**: Drowning damage is more forgiving underwater
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.1)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Drowning tick rate modification

**Details:**
Counter-based mixin reduces drowning damage rate from 1 to 4 seconds by blocking 3 of 4 damage ticks via hurtServer interception. Counter resets when entity surfaces.

### Phase 7: Spear Removal

**Goal**: Spears cannot be obtained by players
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Spear crafting and loot removal

**Details:**
8 spear recipes filtered from crafting via RecipeManagerMixin. 7 spear item types filtered from all loot drops via LootTableEvents.MODIFY_DROPS. Uses Set-based lookup for efficiency.

### Phase 8: Projectile Combat

**Goal**: Player projectiles create danger and have enhanced physics
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: Projectile hit effects and aggro
- [x] 08-02: Projectile physics overhaul

**Details:**
Plan 01: Mixin applies Speed II (6s), Glowing (6s), and aggro redirect to mobs hit by player projectiles.

Plan 02: Player projectiles travel 20% faster (1.2x velocity boost on launch). After 8 blocks, quadratic gravity increase: 0.01 * ((distance - 8) / 8)^2, capped at 0.1. Makes close-range powerful but requires skill at range.

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Counter-based damage interception for rate limiting (Phase 6)
- hurtServer interception over baseTick modification (Phase 6)
- Set-based recipe path filtering in RecipeManagerMixin (Phase 7)
- Combined shield and spear filtering into unified removedItems set (Phase 7)
- Projectile hit modification via onHitEntity inject with owner check (Phase 8)
- TAIL injection on shoot, HEAD injection on tick for physics (Phase 8)
- @Unique spawn tracking for distance calculation (Phase 8)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Wrong method name for mixin targets (hurt vs hurtServer, onEntityHit vs onHitEntity)
- API method rename (location() vs identifier())
- Constant rename (MOVEMENT_SPEED vs SPEED)

**Issues Deferred:**
None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None
