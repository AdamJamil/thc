- [x] **WORLD-05**: Mobs cannot spawn in base chunks

## v2 Requirements

None deferred.

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Tipped tiered arrows | Complexity - defer if needed later |
| Crossbow-specific arrow behavior | Uses same arrows, no special handling needed |
| Threat persistence across chunk unload | Threat is ephemeral, mobs forget when unloaded |
| Threat on passive mobs | Only hostile/neutral mobs track threat |
