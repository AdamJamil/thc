# Milestone v1.3: Extra Features Batch 3

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-20
**Phases:** 12-16
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

Combat rebalancing (melee weakened, ranged gated), wind charge mobility system, threat-based aggro management, and world difficulty tuning.

## Phases

### Phase 12: Combat Rebalancing

**Goal**: Melee weakened, arrow effects enhanced to push players toward ranged combat
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.3)
**Requirements**: COMBAT-01, COMBAT-02, COMBAT-03, COMBAT-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: Arrow combat modifications
- [x] 12-02: Melee damage reduction

**Success Criteria:**
1. Arrow hits cause Speed 4 on target mob (not Speed 2)
2. Arrow hits do not knock back enemy mobs
3. Sweeping edge enchantment has no effect on weapon hits
4. All melee damage is reduced by 75%

### Phase 13: Wind Charge Mobility

**Goal**: Wind charges become core mobility tool with fall damage negation
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: WIND-01, WIND-02, WIND-03
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 13-01: Breeze rod yield modification
- [x] 13-02: Wind charge physics and fall negation

**Success Criteria:**
1. Crafting breeze rod yields 12 wind charges (not 4)
2. Wind charge self-boost launches player 50% higher than vanilla
3. After wind charge self-boost, player negates fall damage on next landing

### Phase 14: Ranged Weapon Gating

**Goal**: Bows and crossbows require Trial Chamber materials
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: RANGED-01, RANGED-02, RANGED-03, RANGED-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01: Bow and crossbow recipe modifications
- [x] 14-02: Bow and crossbow loot removal

**Success Criteria:**
1. Bow recipe requires 3 breeze rods + 3 string (no sticks)
2. Crossbow recipe requires breeze rod + diamond (no sticks/iron)
3. Bows do not appear in any overworld chest loot tables
4. Crossbows do not appear in any overworld chest loot tables
5. Bows do not drop from any mob (skeleton, stray, etc.)
6. Crossbows do not drop from any mob (pillager, piglin)

### Phase 15: Threat System

**Goal**: Tactical aggro management where damage creates threat across nearby mobs
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Requirements**: THREAT-01, THREAT-02, THREAT-03, THREAT-04, THREAT-05, THREAT-06
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01: Threat data structure and storage
- [x] 15-02: Threat propagation on damage
- [x] 15-03: Threat decay system
- [x] 15-04: Threat-based targeting behavior

**Success Criteria:**
1. Each mob maintains a threat map (player → double)
2. Dealing damage to a mob adds that damage value as threat to all hostile/neutral mobs within 15 blocks
3. Threat decays by 1 per second per player per mob
4. Arrow hits add +10 bonus threat to the struck mob
5. Mobs target highest-threat player when any player's threat ≥ 5 (unless revenge takes priority)
6. Mobs only switch targets on: revenge strike OR another player gains strictly higher threat

### Phase 16: World Difficulty

**Goal**: Harder world outside bases, safer inside bases
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: WORLD-01, WORLD-02, WORLD-03, WORLD-04, WORLD-05
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 16-01: Mob griefing and smooth stone
- [x] 16-02: Regional difficulty and moon phase
- [x] 16-03: Base chunk spawn blocking

**Success Criteria:**
1. Mob griefing is disabled (creepers don't destroy blocks, endermen don't pick up blocks)
2. Smooth stone drops cobblestone when mined without silk touch
3. Regional difficulty is always at maximum in every chunk
4. Moon phase is always treated as "true" for all mob/difficulty checks
5. Mobs cannot spawn naturally in base chunks
