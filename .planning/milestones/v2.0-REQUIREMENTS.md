- [x] **SPAWN-01**: Hostile mobs can spawn regardless of sky light level
- [x] **SPAWN-02**: Block light still affects spawn density (vanilla behavior preserved)

### Passive Mobs

- [x] **BED-02**: Sleeping does not skip time or advance day/night cycle
- [x] **BED-03**: Beds still set spawn point when used

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Weather visual override | Rain during dusk is atmospheric, acceptable |
| Nether/End twilight | These dimensions have their own aesthetics |
| Shader-specific fixes | Basic compatibility expected, deep Iris integration deferred |
| Phantom spawning changes | Phantoms should still spawn based on insomnia mechanic |
