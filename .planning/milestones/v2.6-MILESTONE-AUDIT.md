## Key Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| SOUL-LOOT-01 | Flat +1% Looting bonus | Simpler than per-level scaling |
| CMBT-ARROW-01 | Arrow Speed III | Reduces kiting effectiveness |
| WRLD-EXEMPT-01 | BlockTags for exempt categories | Auto-covers all variants |
| SPAWN-WITHER-01 | 15% wither skeleton weight | Meaningful but not dominant |
| THRT-PROX-01 | 5 block radius | Balanced aggro spread |
| VILL-POI-01 | Intercept updatePOIOnBlockStateChange | Upstream blocking |
| VILL-BRAIN-01 | ServerHolder singleton | Brain mixin server access |
| SMTH-BARRIER-01 | Barrier block as dummy template | Recipe compatibility |
| SMTH-COUNT-01 | Material counts match crafting | Intuitive upgrade costs |
| SMTH-TOOL-01 | Smooth stone for wooden→stone | Available early game |
