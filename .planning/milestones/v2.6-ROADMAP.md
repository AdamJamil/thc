# Milestone v2.6: Extra Features Batch 10

**Status:** In Progress
**Phases:** 57-61
**Total Plans:** TBD

## Overview

Quality-of-life improvements across combat, crafting, and world interaction. Soul economy expansion with illager drops and soul soil crafting, threat system refinement with proximity damage propagation, mining fatigue exemption expansion for common block interactions, village deregistration in claimed territory, and a complete smithing table overhaul enabling tier upgrades with enchantment preservation.

## Phases

### Phase 57: Soul Economy & Combat Tuning

**Goal**: Players can farm soul dust from illagers and craft soul soil; arrow and melee balance adjusted
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SOUL-01, SOUL-02, CMBT-01, CMBT-02
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 57-01-PLAN.md - Soul dust drops, soul soil recipe, arrow speed nerf, pillager damage buff

**Success Criteria:**
1. Pillagers, Vindicators, Evokers, Illusioners, Ravagers, and Witches drop soul dust at 20% rate on death
2. 4 soul dust in 2x2 crafting grid produces 1 soul soil
3. Arrow hit speed effect is Speed III (not Speed IV)
4. Melee pillager attacks deal 6.5 damage (up from 4.5)

### Phase 58: Mining Fatigue Exemptions

**Goal**: Players can interact with common world blocks without mining fatigue penalty outside bases
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent)
**Requirements**: WRLD-01, WRLD-02, WRLD-03, WRLD-04, WRLD-05, WRLD-06, WRLD-07, WRLD-08
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 58-01-PLAN.md - Gravel flint drops and expanded mining fatigue exemptions

**Success Criteria:**
1. Breaking gravel with shovel always drops flint (100% rate)
2. Gravel, grass blocks, flower blocks, ore blocks, glass blocks, and beds are exempt from mining fatigue
3. All placeable-anywhere blocks (existing allowlist) remain exempt from mining fatigue
4. Mining fatigue still applies to all other blocks outside bases

---

### Phase 59: Spawn Distribution & Proximity Threat

**Goal**: Deepslate region has wither skeletons in spawn pool; damage dealing propagates threat to nearby mobs
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent)
**Requirements**: SPAWN-01, SPAWN-02, SPAWN-03, THRT-01, THRT-02

**Success Criteria:**
1. Wither skeletons spawn in deepslate region at 15% weight
2. Deepslate pillager spawn weight is 20% (reduced from 25%)
3. Deepslate vanilla fallback is 35% (reduced from 45%)
4. Dealing X damage adds ceil(X/4) threat to all mobs within 5 blocks of player
5. Direct damage target does not receive the threat bonus (only nearby mobs)

---

### Phase 60: Village Deregistration

**Goal**: Claimed chunks do not contribute to village mechanics (villager counts, bed counts)
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent)
**Requirements**: TERR-01, TERR-02

**Success Criteria:**
1. Villagers standing in claimed chunks do not count towards village population
2. Beds placed in claimed chunks do not count towards village bed count
3. Villages outside claimed territory function normally
4. Villagers and beds in unclaimed chunks still register to nearby villages

---

### Phase 61: Smithing Table Tier Upgrades

**Goal**: Players can upgrade equipment tiers at smithing tables, preserving enchantments and using crafting-equivalent material costs
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent)
**Requirements**: SMTH-01, SMTH-02, SMTH-03, SMTH-04, SMTH-05, SMTH-06, SMTH-07, SMTH-08, SMTH-09, SMTH-10, SMTH-11

**Success Criteria:**
1. Leather armor upgrades to copper armor using copper ingots (count matches crafting recipe)
2. Copper armor upgrades to iron armor using iron ingots (count matches crafting recipe)
3. Iron armor upgrades to diamond armor using diamonds (count matches crafting recipe)
4. Wooden tools upgrade to stone using smooth stone (count matches crafting recipe)
5. Stone tools upgrade to copper using copper ingots (count matches crafting recipe)
6. Copper tools upgrade to iron using iron ingots (count matches crafting recipe)
7. Iron tools upgrade to diamond using diamonds (count matches crafting recipe)
8. All tier upgrades preserve enchantments from source item
9. All tier upgrades restore durability to maximum
10. Existing diamond to netherite upgrade via smithing template still works
11. Smithing table can be crafted with copper ingots as alternative to iron recipe
