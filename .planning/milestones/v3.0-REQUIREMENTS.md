# Requirements: THC v3.0 Revival System

**Defined:** 2026-01-31
**Core Value:** Risk must be required for progress. No tedious grinding to avoid challenge.

## v3.0 Requirements

Requirements for revival system. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Downed State

- [x] **DOWN-01**: Player enters downed state when HP reaches 0 (instead of dying)
- [x] **DOWN-02**: Downed player is set to spectator mode
- [x] **DOWN-03**: Downed player's downed location is tracked (for tether and revival)
- [x] **DOWN-04**: Downed player is teleported back if more than 50 blocks from downed location
- [x] **DOWN-05**: Spectator mode provides invulnerability and mob AI exclusion automatically

### Revival Mechanics

- [x] **REVV-01**: Alive player can revive downed player by sneaking within 2 blocks
- [x] **REVV-02**: Reviver must stay still while reviving (movement pauses progress)
- [x] **REVV-03**: Revival progress increases at 0.5 per tick (10 seconds total)
- [x] **REVV-04**: Support class revival progress is 1.0 per tick (5 seconds total)
- [x] **REVV-05**: Revival progress is preserved when interrupted (does not reset)

### Revival UI

- [x] **RVUI-01**: Radial progress ring displays around cursor when looking at downed player within 2 blocks
- [x] **RVUI-02**: Empty ring texture (revival_progress_empty.png) shown at 0% progress
- [x] **RVUI-03**: Filled ring texture (revival_progress_full.png) fills radially with progress percentage

### Revival Outcome

- [x] **RVOU-01**: Revived player is set back to survival mode
- [x] **RVOU-02**: Revived player is teleported to their downed location
- [x] **RVOU-03**: Revived player has 50% of max HP
- [x] **RVOU-04**: Revived player has 0 hunger (adjusted to 6 per CONTEXT.md)
- [x] **RVOU-05**: Green particles play on successful revival

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones.

- **DOWN-06**: Bleedout timer (die after N seconds if not revived) - deferred, may add if solo play becomes issue
- **REVV-06**: Self-revive mechanic - explicitly excluded per design
- **RVUI-04**: Downed player indicator visible through walls - deferred

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Bleedout timer | User specified indefinite downed duration |
| Self-revive | Against cooperative design intent |
| Revive items | Keep revival purely cooperative |
| Knockdown shield | Complexity, not part of spec |
| Multiple revivers stacking | Single reviver model simpler (note: stacking works naturally) |
| Visible downed body | Spectator mode approach - body is invisible |
