# Roadmap: THC v3.4 Bow Overhaul

## Overview

Three-phase delivery of bow combat differentiation. Phase 86 reworks the vanilla bow into a "Wooden Bow" foundation with new horizontal drag arrow physics, half damage, tipped arrow restriction, and glowing removal. Phase 87 adds the Blaze Bow (Ranged class, fire damage, slow draw). Phase 88 adds the Breeze Bow (Support class, knockback, fast draw). Each bow phase is a complete vertical slice: item, recipe, mechanics, damage profile, and gating.

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 86: Wooden Bow Foundation** - Rename vanilla bow, new arrow physics, half damage, glowing removal
- [ ] **Phase 87: Blaze Bow** - Fire-damage bow for Ranged class with slow draw
- [ ] **Phase 88: Breeze Bow** - Knockback bow for Support class with fast draw

## Phase Details

### Phase 86: Wooden Bow Foundation
**Goal**: Players use a renamed "Wooden Bow" with new horizontal drag arrow physics, reduced damage, tipped arrow restriction, and no glowing on projectile hits
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: ITEM-01, ITEM-02, PHYS-01, PHYS-02, PHYS-03, DMG-01, DMG-05, MECH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Vanilla bow displays as "Wooden Bow" in inventory and tooltips, craftable with 3 sticks + 3 string
  2. Player arrows lose horizontal speed over distance via drag coefficient (not the old gravity-over-time curve) and the old physics are fully removed
  3. Arrows fired from the Wooden Bow deal 50% of their normal final damage
  4. Mobs hit by player projectiles no longer receive the Glowing effect
  5. Attempting to fire a tipped arrow from the Wooden Bow consumes a regular arrow instead (tipped arrows blocked)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 87: Blaze Bow
**Goal**: Ranged-class players at Stage 2+ can craft and use a Blaze Bow that sets targets on fire with a slower draw speed
**Depends on**: Phase 86 (arrow physics and bow tagging infrastructure)
**Requirements**: ITEM-03, ITEM-04, DMG-03, MECH-01, GATE-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Blaze Bow item exists with custom textures (idle and pulling states) and is craftable with 3 blaze rods + 3 string
  2. Arrows fired from the Blaze Bow set the target on fire for 3 seconds (0.5 damage/second)
  3. Blaze Bow takes 1.5x longer to fully draw compared to the Wooden Bow
  4. Non-Ranged players or players below Stage 2 cannot use the Blaze Bow and see an actionbar message explaining why
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 88: Breeze Bow
**Goal**: Support-class players at Stage 2+ can craft and use a Breeze Bow that knocks targets back and draws faster
**Depends on**: Phase 86 (arrow physics and bow tagging infrastructure)
**Requirements**: ITEM-05, ITEM-06, DMG-02, MECH-02, GATE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Breeze Bow item exists with custom textures (idle and pulling states) and is craftable with 3 breeze rods + 3 string
  2. Arrows fired from the Breeze Bow deal 75% final damage and apply regular arrow knockback to targets
  3. Breeze Bow draws in 0.75x the time of the Wooden Bow
  4. Non-Support players or players below Stage 2 cannot use the Breeze Bow and see an actionbar message explaining why

**Plans**: TBD
