<objective>
Remove low-value food recipes: suspicious stew, mushroom stew, beetroot soup, and sugar from sugarcane.

Purpose: Simplify food choices by removing low-value options, driving players toward meaningful food progression.
Output: Updated RecipeManagerMixin with 4 additional recipe paths filtered.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add food recipes to REMOVED_RECIPE_PATHS</name>
  <files>src/main/java/thc/mixin/RecipeManagerMixin.java</files>
  <action>
Add these 4 recipe paths to the REMOVED_RECIPE_PATHS Set:
- "suspicious_stew" (vanilla recipe ID for suspicious stew)
- "mushroom_stew" (vanilla recipe ID for mushroom stew)
- "beetroot_soup" (vanilla recipe ID for beetroot soup)
- "sugar_from_sugar_cane" (vanilla recipe ID for sugarcane → sugar)

Note: The sugar recipe ID is "sugar_from_sugar_cane", not just "sugar" (which would block honey-based sugar).
  </action>
  <verify>./gradlew build succeeds, grep confirms all 4 paths present</verify>
  <done>RecipeManagerMixin contains all 4 food recipe paths in REMOVED_RECIPE_PATHS set</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `./gradlew build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] grep -E "suspicious_stew|mushroom_stew|beetroot_soup|sugar_from_sugar_cane" finds all 4 in RecipeManagerMixin.java
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- RecipeManagerMixin updated with 4 new recipe paths
- Build succeeds
- All truths verifiable: recipes will be filtered at runtime
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/32-food-removals/32-01-SUMMARY.md`
