# Phase 48: Copper Bucket - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Early-game bucket alternative craftable with copper. Can hold water and milk only — cannot pick up lava, powder snow, or other fluids. Provides a cheaper bucket option before iron is available.

## Implementation Decisions

### Fluid restriction feedback
- Silent fail when player attempts to pick up lava, powder snow, or other restricted fluids
- No sound, no message — player learns through discovery
- Matches minimalist feedback pattern

### Claude's Discretion
- Texture style (polished vs weathered copper appearance)
- Item registration approach
- Recipe data generation method

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches matching existing item patterns.
