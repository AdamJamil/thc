<objective>
Add alternative smithing table crafting recipe using copper ingots and verify netherite upgrades unchanged.

Purpose: Allow players to craft smithing tables earlier in progression using copper (more accessible than iron).
Output: New crafting recipe for smithing table using copper ingots.

  <action>
Create smithing_table_copper.json in src/main/resources/data/thc/recipe/:

```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:crafting_shaped",
  "category": "misc",
  "key": {
    "#": "#minecraft:planks",
    "@": "minecraft:copper_ingot"
  },
  "pattern": [
    "@@",
    "##",
    "##"
  ],
  "result": {
    "count": 1,
    "id": "minecraft:smithing_table"
  }
}
```

This adds an alternative recipe - vanilla iron recipe remains (smithing table can be crafted with either copper or iron ingots).

Matches vanilla pattern but substitutes copper_ingot for iron_ingot:
- 2 copper ingots on top
- 4 planks (any type) filling bottom

This does NOT override the vanilla recipe - it adds a new recipe with a different ID (thc:smithing_table_copper vs minecraft:smithing_table).

Run `./gradlew build` - JSON is valid and included in JAR.

Smithing table can be crafted with copper ingots as alternative to iron recipe.

  <name>Task 2: Verify Netherite Upgrade Compatibility</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Verify that SmithingMenuMixin (from Plan 01) does NOT interfere with vanilla netherite upgrades:

1. Check that the mixin's tier upgrade validation only triggers for items in the TierUpgradeConfig maps
2. Verify netherite upgrade items are NOT in the config:
   - DIAMOND_HELMET, DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE, etc. are NOT base items for tier upgrades
   - NETHERITE_INGOT is NOT in the addition materials
3. Confirm the mixin logic flow:
   - If TierUpgradeConfig.isValidTierUpgrade() returns false, mixin does nothing
   - Vanilla smithing logic proceeds normally for netherite upgrades

If Plan 01's SmithingMenuMixin is already properly scoped (only intercepts configured tier upgrades), no code changes needed - just document the verification.

If there's any overlap (e.g., diamond armor as base), ensure the mixin explicitly excludes netherite upgrade paths:
- Check if template slot contains netherite_upgrade_smithing_template
- If yes, skip tier upgrade logic and let vanilla handle it

Note: This task may require reading Plan 01's implementation to verify. If the mixin is correctly scoped, this task is documentation-only.
  </action>
  <verify>
Review SmithingMenuMixin.java and TierUpgradeConfig.kt to confirm diamond->netherite upgrades are not intercepted.
  </verify>
  <done>
Diamond to netherite upgrade works via vanilla smithing system without interference from tier upgrade mixin.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `./gradlew build` succeeds
2. smithing_table_copper.json exists with correct recipe format
3. SmithingMenuMixin does not intercept netherite upgrades (diamond is base for tier upgrades but netherite_ingot is not in addition materials)
4. Vanilla netherite_*_smithing.json recipes remain functional
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- SMTH-10: Existing diamond to netherite upgrade unchanged (mixin scoping verification)
- SMTH-11: Smithing table craftable with copper ingots (new recipe)
</success_criteria>
