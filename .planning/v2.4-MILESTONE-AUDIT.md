# Milestone v2.4 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v2.4 Extra Features Batch 8
**Audited:** 2026-01-26T15:00:00Z
**Status:** gaps_found

## Executive Summary

Milestone v2.4 has 6 of 7 phases complete. Phase 46 (Iron Boat) is **missing verification** - plans executed but no VERIFICATION.md exists to confirm goal achievement. All other phases passed verification with no gaps.

## Scores

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Requirements | 19/24 (79%) | 5 gaps (Phase 46) |
| Phases | 6/7 (86%) | 1 unverified |
| Integration | 24/24 (100%) | All wired |
| E2E Flows | 3/3 (100%) | All complete |

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Plans | Verified | Status |
|-------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 46 | Iron Boat | 3/3 | **NO** | **UNVERIFIED** |
| 47 | Saddle Removal | 1/1 | YES | passed |
| 48 | Copper Bucket | 1/1 | YES | passed |
| 49 | Fluid Placement Mechanics | 1/1 | YES | passed |
| 50 | Elytra Flight Changes | 1/1 | YES | passed |
| 51 | Brewing Removal | 1/1 | YES | passed |
| 52 | Armor Rebalancing | 1/1 | YES | passed |

## Unsatisfied Requirements

All gaps are in Phase 46 (Iron Boat):

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| BOAT-01 | Iron boat item craftable | 46 | Phase unverified |
| BOAT-02 | Iron boat uses custom texture | 46 | Phase unverified |
| BOAT-03 | Iron boat works on lava | 46 | Phase unverified |
| BOAT-04 | Iron boat item drop is lava-proof | 46 | Phase unverified |
| BOAT-05 | Iron boat item flies to player | 46 | Phase unverified |

**Note:** Phase 46 has 3 SUMMARY.md files indicating plans executed, but no VERIFICATION.md to confirm requirements satisfied:
- 46-01-SUMMARY.md: Entity + item registration complete
- 46-02-SUMMARY.md: Renderer + recipe + assets complete
- 46-03-SUMMARY.md: Skipped by user (passenger protection)

The code likely satisfies requirements, but without verification report we cannot confirm.

## Verified Requirements

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| SADL-01 | Saddles removed from chest loot | 47 | SATISFIED |
| SADL-02 | Mobs no longer drop saddles | 47 | SATISFIED |
| SADL-03 | Saddle recipe removed | 47 | SATISFIED |
| BUCK-01 | Copper bucket craftable | 48 | SATISFIED |
| BUCK-02 | Copper bucket water/milk only | 48 | SATISFIED |
| BUCK-03 | Copper bucket custom textures | 48 | SATISFIED |
| BUCK-04 | Lava buckets cannot be placed | 49 | SATISFIED |
| WATR-01 | Water placement creates flowing water | 49 | SATISFIED |
| WATR-02 | Placed water has vanilla physics | 49 | SATISFIED |
| ELYT-01 | Fireworks no longer propel elytra | 50 | SATISFIED |
| ELYT-02 | Elytra gains 2x speed diving | 50 | SATISFIED |
| ELYT-03 | Elytra loses 1.8x speed ascending | 50 | SATISFIED |
| BREW-01 | Brewing stands removed from spawns | 51 | SATISFIED |
| BREW-02 | Brewing stand recipe removed | 51 | SATISFIED |
| BREW-03 | Potions removed from bartering | 51 | SATISFIED |
| ARMR-01 | Armor values rebalanced | 52 | SATISFIED |
| ARMR-02 | Toughness values rebalanced | 52 | SATISFIED |
| ARMR-03 | Monotonic armor progression | 52 | SATISFIED |
| ARMR-04 | Half armor points allowed | 52 | SATISFIED |

## Cross-Phase Integration

All integration checks passed.

### Shared Systems

| System | Phases | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| RecipeManagerMixin | 47, 51 | No conflicts - separate REMOVED_RECIPE_PATHS entries |
| StructureTemplateMixin | 51 | Properly adds BREWING_STAND to filtered blocks |
| Loot table overrides | 47, 51 | No overlapping files |
| Bucket systems | 48, 49 | Properly layered (copper → vanilla lava) |

### E2E Flows Verified

1. **Iron Boat Flow:** Recipe → Item → Entity → Lava physics → Renderer (12 steps verified)
2. **Copper Bucket Flow:** Recipe → Water pickup → Flowing water → Cow milking (13 steps verified)
3. **Armor Progression:** Leather (7) → Copper (10) → Iron (15) → Diamond (18+4) → Netherite (20+6)

### Mixin Registration

All 8 phase-related mixins registered in thc.mixins.json:
- BucketItemLavaMixin (Phase 49)
- IronBoatLavaMixin (Phase 46)
- IronBoatPassengerMixin (Phase 46)
- RecipeManagerMixin (Phase 47+51)
- StructureTemplateMixin (Phase 51)
- AbstractVillagerMixin (Phase 47)
- FireworkRocketEntityMixin (Phase 50)
- PlayerElytraMixin (Phase 50)

## Tech Debt

None identified. All implementations are substantive with no TODOs, FIXMEs, or stubs detected.

## Human Verification Items

The following require in-game testing (aggregated from phase verification reports):

### Phase 47 (Saddle Removal)
- Recipe book shows no saddle recipe
- Leatherworker villagers don't offer saddle trades
- Chest loot contains no saddles
- Ravagers drop nothing
- Fishing treasure excludes saddles

### Phase 48 (Copper Bucket)
- Visual texture appearance for all 3 variants
- Water pickup and placement cycle
- Lava rejection (silent fail)
- Cow milking produces copper milk bucket
- Milk effect clearing works

### Phase 49 (Fluid Placement)
- Lava bucket placement blocked
- Copper water bucket places flowing water that drains
- Natural water sources unaffected

### Phase 50 (Elytra)
- Firework boost cancelled during flight
- Diving speed amplification noticeable
- Ascending speed penalty noticeable
- Pitch threshold behavior at horizon

### Phase 51 (Brewing)
- No brewing stands in structures
- No brewing stand recipe in crafting menu
- No fire resistance potions from piglins

### Phase 52 (Armor)
- Armor values display correctly in HUD
- Fractional armor points handled properly
- Tier progression feels significant

## Blockers

**1 Blocker Identified:**

- **Phase 46 (Iron Boat):** Missing VERIFICATION.md prevents confirming 5 requirements

## Recommendations

### Option A: Verify Phase 46 (Recommended)

Run verification on Phase 46 to confirm requirements satisfied:
```
/gsd:verify-work 46
```

If verification passes, all 24 requirements will be satisfied.

### Option B: Complete Milestone with Known Gap

If Phase 46 implementation is trusted based on SUMMARY.md files, proceed with:
```
/gsd:complete-milestone v2.4
```

Requirements BOAT-01 through BOAT-05 will remain unverified but likely functional.
