# v3.4 Bow Overhaul — Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v3.4 Bow Overhaul
**Audited:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** tech_debt (no blockers, 1 intentionally deferred requirement)

## Summary

All 3 phases passed verification. All 4 E2E flows verified complete. 19 of 20 requirements satisfied. One requirement (MECH-04: splash AoE tipped arrows for breeze bow) was intentionally deferred per user decision during Phase 88 execution. No critical blockers.

## Phase Verification Results

| 87 | Blaze Bow | PASSED | 7/7 | None | None |
| 88 | Breeze Bow | PASSED | 9/9 | None | None |

**All 3/3 phases passed verification.**

| GATE-02 | Breeze bow requires Support class Stage 2+ | 88 | Satisfied |

**Score: 19/20 requirements satisfied (1 intentionally deferred)**

### Deferred Requirement Detail

**MECH-04:** Tipped arrows from breeze bow should create splash AoE on impact with per-arrow direct/splash effects. This was deferred per user decision during Phase 88 execution. Tipped arrows currently fire normally from the Breeze Bow and apply direct-hit effects only (no splash AoE).

## Integration Check Results

**Status: PASSED** — All cross-phase wiring verified.

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Wooden Bow: craft → fire → drag → 50% damage → no Glowing → tipped blocked | Complete |
| 2 | Blaze Bow: gate → craft → slow draw → fire → flaming → 100% damage + 3s fire | Complete |
| 3 | Breeze Bow: gate → craft → fast draw → fire → less drag → 75% damage + knockback | Complete |
| 4 | Bow Type Tagging: shoot → tag → read via BowTypeTagAccess → apply effects | Complete |

**Score: 4/4 E2E flows complete. 0 broken.**

### Cross-Phase Wiring

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|------------|------|----|--------|
| BowType enum | Phase 86 | Phases 87, 88 | Wired |
| BowTypeTagAccess interface | Phase 86 | Phases 86-88 (AbstractArrowMixin) | Wired |
| Bow type tagging (ProjectileEntityMixin) | Phase 86 | Phases 87, 88 | Wired |
| Horizontal drag system | Phase 86 | Phases 87, 88 | Wired |
| Damage multiplier chain | Phase 86 | Phases 87, 88 | Wired |
| Class gate pattern | Phase 87 | Phase 88 | Wired |
| Draw speed scaling pattern | Phase 87 | Phase 88 | Wired |

**All 7 cross-phase connections verified. No orphaned exports.**

## Tech Debt

### Phase 88: Breeze Bow
- **Deferred: MECH-04** — Splash AoE tipped arrow behavior for Breeze Bow deferred to future milestone per user decision

### Cross-Phase
- **Minor:** Blaze Bow registered in `THCItems.kt` while Breeze Bow registered in `THCBows.kt` (inconsistent registration location, functionally correct)

**Total: 2 items across 2 areas (0 critical, 2 non-critical)**

## Build Status

All phases compiled successfully. Only pre-existing deprecation warning (THCBucklerGameTests.java:98 — unrelated to v3.4).
